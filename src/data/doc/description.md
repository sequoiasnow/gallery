# Atomic Documentation

This project grew directly out of a blog design I was working on at 
the time and was an effort to modularize and better document the codebase.

What began as a seemingly simple task turned difficult quickly as I realized
that the majority of documentation technology did not work to achieve my aims
in quite the right manner. For modularity I had chosen Brad Frost's Atomic Design
principles but in place of applying them to styling, applied them to React
components. As there didn't exist a documentation library for these componetns
I decided to build my own living style guide.

The results were intriquing as it provided a rapid pace of development for individual
components, but in some cases slowing down the entire design process by focusing on
specific aspects of the work.
