# MA Chronicle

The site pictured above shows a phase of a yearlong development of 
a Wordpress theme built from scratch for the Menlo Atheron Highschool
Journalism program. Initially the site reileid heavilly on php templating
and sass for styling, but over the course of a year became more asynchronous
eventually culminating in an app completly driven by a REST Api. Some
notable features of this design are the sideways navigation, and the pintrest
inspired grid on the frontpage. 

In the end the site won two awward, a National Pacemaker *the highest awward
for highschool journalism in the United States* and an excellence in design
commendation.
