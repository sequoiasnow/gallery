# MA Chronicle

The site pictured above shows a phase of a yearlong development of
a Wordpress theme built from scratch for the Menlo Atherton High school
Journalism program. Initially the site relied heavily on php templating
and sass for styling, but over the course of a year became more asynchronous
eventually culminating in an app completely driven by a REST Api. Some
notable features of this design are the sideways navigation, and the Pinterest
inspired grid on the front page.

In the end the site won two award, a National Pacemaker *the highest award
for high school journalism in the United States* and an excellence in design
commendation.
