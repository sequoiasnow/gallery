# Blog Demonstration

This project was never actually put into production, but merely the result of
some experimentation with svg I was doing at the time. It was an effort to build
a retro looking blog (I'll admit to many of the design choices reflecting my love
of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon). I had originally intended to use it for
my own personal site, but decided to refactor some of the code to be better documented
in an effort to make it more modular.

The site itself used react in its entirety as well as a custom api built completely
in Haskell. The later provided incredible type safety and speed in serving data
from a standard Postgresql database. Over the course of this project, which was
originally inspired by my acquisition of a free trial of Sketch, I also came to
build some SVG animations and components - a process which forever indebted those
technologies to me.
