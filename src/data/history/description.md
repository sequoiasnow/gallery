# History 80Y

This project was the cullmination of work for a class on the Second World War
in the Pacific. The goal of the project was to make a website and so I gladly 
took over that part of the effort in order to apply some more interesting 
design standards. The spiral view itself is completly based on a design I first
saw by Nick Jones, but completly reimplemented in Reactjs.
