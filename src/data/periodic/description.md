# Periodic Spelling

This site came as a small offshoot from fun I'd been having with a blog
deign. I created a react component that, given the chemical symbol of an 
element would generate and SVG for that element with all the information
usually shown on a periodic table. Purely for fun, I then posted this online
as a way to spell out names and words using purely the elements. While a 
simple project, the results are quite entertaining, visit it
